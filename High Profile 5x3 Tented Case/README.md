# High Profile 5x3 Tented Case

This is a high-profile case with outer column removed (5x3).

### A Note on Choc Switches

The design has been tested with both Kailh Choc and MX switches. However, the 
post heights should be made taller if you intend to use Choc switches. I
recommend raising the posts to 3mm.

## Tenting Legs

The Fusion 360 file includes printable tenting legs. However, I do not recommend them.
I recommend the ZSA tenting legs due to their superior stability and rubberized tips to prevent
sliding on the table. The ZSA legs have no issuses with slipping in any tenting/tilting angle.

## Assembly

1. Print the left and right cases.
1. Using a soldering iron with a heat-set insert tool, press the insert in to the
6 posts on the bottom inside of the case. They should sit flush with the top of the
post.
1. One at a time, insert a hex screw into the cutout on the inner wall of the case.
Using a slodering iron with a fine tip, press on the edge of the nut until one side 
slightly sinks in to the case. Move the tip to the opposite side of the nut and 
continue pressing until the nut is inset slighty below the edge of the case wall. 
Do not make it flush.
1. Once cooled, place your finger over the the nut. With your other hand, insert 
the tenting leg and screw it in. You will need to tighten the nut sufficiently to
grip the plastic of the case. You may want to use an allen key but don't overdue it.
